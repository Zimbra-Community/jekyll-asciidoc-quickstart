== Basic information
This documentation repository is hosted on GitHub pages, which is based on the https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll framework].

On top of this, we use a https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/jekyll-asciidoc-quickstart/[TravisCI automation] to both recompile the site after a new post is added and to support the https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor markup language].

== Creating new content
Articles must be written in Asciidoctor, and all articles must have the following header (example taken from this very article):

----
= Contributing to this documentation repo
:showtitle:
:page-navtitle: Contributing to this documentation repo.
:page-excerpt: A quick guide about how to contribute to this documentation repository.
:page-root: ../../../

----

.Header Elements
[options="header"]
|===
|Property|Description
a|`= [Insert title here]`|Defines the Asciidoc title of the page.
a|`:showtitle:`|Instructs Asciidoctor to print the article's title at the beginning of the page.
a|`:page-navtitle: [Insert title here]`|Defines the Jekyll 'navtitle' variable, which should be the same as the article's title.
a|`:page-excerpt: [Insert excerpt here]`|Defines the Jekyll 'excerpt' variable, which should be an except of the article content.
a|`:page-root: ../../../`|Defines the article's root. Due to the repository's structure, it must always be `../../../`
a|`:imagesdir: images/2020-01-13-Contributing-to-this-documentation-repo/`|Defines the directory that contains all screenshots and images displayed in the article.
|===

A blank line must always be added between the header and the first section of the article, and no blank lines must be added within the header.

After the header, the real article begins with at least a Level 1 section:

Articles can have nested sections, but I suggest to avoid nesting too much to improve readability.

[https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/The full Asciidoctor User Manual can be found here].

TIP: Simple is often better: try to express one concept per sentence, and use a newline to separate paragraphs.

It contains *everything* you can do with the language, so I strongly suggest to have a quick look at it to find out the options you have when writing an article and then use it as a reference for your specific needs.

=== Images and Screenshots
Images and screenshots must be placed in a subdirectory of `/_resources/images/` named as the article file (without the .adoc extension).

As seen above, each article must have its own images directory, which is defined in the header by the `:imagesdir:` attribute.

The Asciidoctor base syntax to include an inline image is `image::filename.jpg[]` - the Alt Text, width and height of the image can be entered in this order between the brackets, e.g.:

----
$ ls _resources/images/2020-01-13-Contributing-to-this-documentation-repo/
smiley.jpg

----

----
:imagesdir: /_resources/images/2020-01-13-Contributing-to-this-documentation-repo/
[...]
image::smiley.jpg[Smiley,300]
----

image::smiley.jpg[Smiley,300]

Alternatively, external images can also be added inline using a full URL:

----

----
image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tux.svg[Tux,250,350]


=== Tables
Among all the Asciidoctor features that can be used, tables are usually the most useful. As an example, this is the code for Table 1 above:

----

[options="header"]
|===
a|`= [Insert title here]`|Defines the Asciidoc title of the page.
a|`:showtitle:`|Instructs Asciidoctor to print the article's title at the beginning of the page.
a|`:page-navtitle: [Insert title here]`|Defines the Jekyll 'navtitle' variable, which should be the same as the article's title.
a|`:page-excerpt: [Insert excerpt here]`|Defines the Jekyll 'excerpt' variable, which should be an except of the article content.
a|`:page-root: ../../../`|Defines the article's root. Due to the repository's structure, it must always be `../../../`
a|`:imagesdir: images/2020-01-13-Contributing-to-this-documentation-repo/`|Defines the directory that contains all screenshots and images displayed in the article.
|===
----

Basic table structure in Asciidoctor is fairly simple, with `|===` serving as the table boundary and cells being defined by the `|` separator.

In the example above includes two "advanced" table features - a header row and cell formatting. Please refer to the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables["Tables" section of the Asciidoctor user manual] for more information about those and the other many formatting options available.

=== Editors
There are several editors that support Asciidoc syntax highlighting and page previewing either natively or via a plugin - my personal choice is GitHub's own https://atom.io[Atom] with the `language-asciidoc`, `asciidoc-preview` and `autocomplete-asciidoc` packages.

This editor is available for Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux, and has a built-in GitHub client you can use to publish your articles straight away.

== Adding the content to the site
New posts are added as a single file within the `_posts` subdirectory of the *master* branch.

Each post's name must comply to the following naming convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD-title-separated-by-dashes.adoc`

TIP: As a rule of thumb, the title in the filename should always be the same as those in the file's header (title and navtitle).

To publish an article you just need to open a Pull Request on the *master* branch with your content
